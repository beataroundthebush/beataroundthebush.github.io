## Sept 06 - Songs About Me

This week seems to be Josh Turner heavy! But I've always loved his deep voice from the first moment I heard it - incidentally it was **_The Long Black Train_**

_**Country State of Mind** - Josh Turner_ 
I have listened to this with a beer in hand, on a sunday, reading a book and not thinking about anything else (ok maybe the biriyani that is supposedly for lunch!)

_**Everything is Fine** - Josh Turner_
always reminds me of that life is actually good, and i've a lot of blessings that i need to start counting

_**Your Man** - Josh Turner_
This was a nice song but not really anywhere near my faves until i heard this story. Seems this was one of his earlier hits and the music video shows him and his actual wife on a date and then in a hotel room. They remade this video again, 15 yrs later. Both of them again. He was a wildly successful singer by then and by the looks of it in a successful and happy marriage as well.

_**Achy Breaky Heart** - Billy Ray Cyrus_  
Am sure you've heard of this. Funny line i liked - "tell your brother cliff, who's fist can tell me lips that he never really liked me anyway .."

_**Songs About Me** - Trace Adkins_ 
About an idiot guy on a plane who needed convincing that country songs are about real life and they really are songs about me
